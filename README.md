# Interface DSP c5535 with ILI9341 based TFT Display

Based on Adafruit GFX, SPI and ILI9341

## Requirements

- DSP Evaluation kit (http://www.ti.com/tool/TMDX5535EZDSP)
- 2.8 or 2.4 inches TFT Display with ILI9341 driver IC
- Code Composer Studio V8

Note:-
1. Adapted from Arduino based GFX Library.
2. Support for printing string is not added. Need to find a way to either make the existing "Print.h" work or find a replacement to that.

Tested with DSP C5535 kit but may also work with DSP C5515 kit
